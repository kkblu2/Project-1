## ✨ Features

- 🔑 Automatic key generation and storage
- 🔒 File encryption with a unique key
- 🔓 File decryption using the stored key
- 🛡️ Secure Fernet encryption algorithm
- 🖥️ User-friendly command-line interface

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- cryptography library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

## 🔮 How It Works

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Generate a unique encryption key             │
│ 2. Store the key securely in 'Secret.key'       │
│ 3. Use the key to encrypt or decrypt files      │
│ 4. Encrypted files are safe from unauthorized   │
│    access                                       │
